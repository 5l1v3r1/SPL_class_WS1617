Description:      'Calculates Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk using three different methods, namely Historical Simulation, 
                   Analytical Models and Monte Carlo Simulation. In Historical Simulation VaR and CVaR are calculated using equally weighted
                   as well as differently weighted returns. As Analytical models normal distribution, Student''s t-distribution 
                   and Cornish-Fisher Expansion were implemented to compute VaR and CVaR. In Monte Carlo Simulation the calculation of VaR 
                   and CVaR is based on the generation of normally distributed random log-returns using Geometric Brownian Motion or 
                   alternatively on the generation of Student''s t-distributed random log-returns.'

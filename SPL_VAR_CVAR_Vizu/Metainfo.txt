Name of Quantlet: SPL_VAR_CVAR_Vizu
 
Published in:     'Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Applied Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk'''
   
Description:      'This quantlet covers all plots for the three quantlets VaR_and_CVaR_Quantlet, Testing_Quantlet and
                   PortfolioOptimization. For VaR_and_CVaR_Quantlet it plots different distributions (normal, Student''s t and
                   empirical distributions) with corresponding VaR and CVaR calculated within VaR_and_CVaR_Quantlet. For the
                   Testing_Quantlet it plots two different distributions in order to compare these distributions as well as plotting
                   the results of the Kupiec Test for the VaR and McNeal & Frey test for the CVaR. For the PortfolioOptimization 
                   Quantlet, it plots the portfolios weights and let liquidation value over time as well as the efficient frontiers.'

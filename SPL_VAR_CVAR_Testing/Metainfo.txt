Name of Quantlet: SPL_VAR_CVAR_Testing
 
Published in:     'Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Applied Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk'''
   
Description:      'Contains two different kind of tests. The function allows to execute three distribution tests, namely the 
                   Kolmogorow-Smirnov test, Kuiper´s test and the Anderson-Darling test, to find out whether data is normally 
                   distributed or Student´s t distributed (one-sample distribution test). Futhermore the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
                   test performs a two-sample distribution test, to find out whether two datasets follow the same distribution. 
                   The second type of test is an unconditional coverage test, namely Kupiec''s test, to test the Values at Risk. 
                   Futhermore a test for the CVaR based on McNeil and Frey is implemented.'

Output:           'Data for Plot_Quantlet, test results of own goodness of fit function and test results of distribution tests 
                   that are already implemented in R for normality an t distribution, test results for Kupiec''s unconditional 
                   coverage test'
